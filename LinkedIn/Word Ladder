1. Do we have duplicates in the word list?
2. Is the length of all the words the same?
3. Are all the words in lower case?

class Solution {
    public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
        Set<String> dict = new HashSet<>(wordList);
        Set<String> reached = new HashSet<>();

        reached.add(beginWord);
        System.out.println(reached);
        int ladder = 1;
        while (!reached.contains(endWord)){
            Set<String> temp = new HashSet<>();
            for (String str:reached){
                for (int i=0;i<str.length();i++){
                    char[] chars = str.toCharArray();
                    //System.out.println(chars);
                    for (char ch = 'a';ch<='z';ch++){
                        chars[i] = ch;
                        //System.out.println("chars[i]:"+chars[i]);
                        String newStr = new String(chars);
                        if (dict.contains(newStr)){
                            temp.add(newStr);
                            dict.remove(newStr);
                           System.out.println(temp);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            ladder += 1;
            if (temp.size() == 0)
                return 0;
            reached = temp;
        }
      //  System.out.println("final-->"+reached);
        return ladder;
    }
}

time - 26 * l * m = 26 * length of the words * size of the reached set

Basically I keep two sets of words, one set reached that represents the borders that have been reached with "distance"-->
ladder variable steps; 
another set wordDict that has not been reached. 
In the while loop, for each word in the reached set, I give all variations and check if 
it matches anything from wordDict, if it has a match, I add that word into temp set, which will be my "reached" set 
in the next loop, and remove the word from wordDict because I already reached it in this step. 
And at the end of while loop, I check the size of temp, which means that if I can't reach any new String from wordDict,
I won't be able to reach the endWord, then just return 0. Finally if the endWord is in reached set, 
I return the current steps "distance".
